-- Fix permissions for public ticket submission
-- This allows the public form to work properly

-- 1. Ensure departments table has proper RLS policies
ALTER TABLE departments ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop existing SELECT policy if it exists
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public can view departments" ON departments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Everyone can view departments" ON departments;

-- Create policy allowing everyone (including anon) to view departments
CREATE POLICY "Everyone can view departments" ON departments
    FOR SELECT
    USING (true);

-- 2. Grant necessary permissions to anon role
GRANT SELECT ON departments TO anon;
GRANT INSERT ON tickets TO anon;
GRANT SELECT ON tickets TO anon;
GRANT INSERT ON email_queue TO anon;

-- 3. Ensure tickets table allows anon insertions
ALTER TABLE tickets ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop and recreate INSERT policy for tickets
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anon can create tickets" ON tickets;

CREATE POLICY "Anon can create tickets" ON tickets
    FOR INSERT
    WITH CHECK (true);

-- Allow anon to read their own tickets (based on email)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own tickets by email" ON tickets;

CREATE POLICY "Users can view own tickets by email" ON tickets
    FOR SELECT
    USING (
        auth.uid() IS NOT NULL -- Authenticated users can see based on other policies
        OR 
        requester_email IS NOT NULL -- Public tickets can be viewed by email (in theory)
    );

-- 4. Ensure email_queue allows anon insertions
ALTER TABLE email_queue ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anon can queue emails" ON email_queue;

CREATE POLICY "Anon can queue emails" ON email_queue
    FOR INSERT
    WITH CHECK (true);

-- 5. Add the missing columns if they don't exist
ALTER TABLE tickets ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS created_via TEXT DEFAULT 'app';
ALTER TABLE tickets ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS requester_phone TEXT;

-- 6. Verify departments exist
INSERT INTO departments (name, email, description) 
VALUES 
  ('Maintenance', 'maintenance@greatlakesg.com', 'Handles all maintenance-related requests'),
  ('Electrical', 'electrical@greatlakesg.com', 'Handles all electrical-related requests')
ON CONFLICT (name) DO NOTHING;

-- 7. Check the setup
SELECT 'Checking departments...' as status;
SELECT id, name, email FROM departments;

SELECT 'Checking RLS policies for departments...' as status;
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'departments';

SELECT 'Setup complete! Departments should now be visible on the public form.' as status;
